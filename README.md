### Hi there 👋
#### I'm Chris – a former agency owner and CEO, now looking for my next challenge.

I spent the last 16 years building and running an agency called [Chromatic](https://chromatichq.com). In early 2024, I sold my stake in the company to start a new chapter in my career. 

I've been writing software since the late 90's and leading engineering teams since 2008. I've written code for websites you've most certainly used. I believe in open source software, native apps over cross-platform frameworks, and in the power of empathetic leadership.

- 🧱 I’m currently **working on** [rebuilding popular iOS](https://github.com/chrisfree/flightySwiftUI) apps with SwiftUI.
- 🌱 I'm **learning** more advanced Swift and SwiftUI techniques.
- 🔍 I’m on the hunt for **technical leadership** roles at ambitious companies. 
- 👨‍🎓 I like to help mid-level engineers and managers level up their careers.

- ⚡ **Fun fact:** I was once reviewing a pull request that included a new bash script for clearing and syncing files across dev environments. When I ran it locally, it wiped my entire hard drive. Needless to say, the PR did not pass code review that day.
- 🏎️ [NextGP](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nextgp/id1638726743) is my tiny little Formula 1 app. It has nifty widgets that countdown to the next Grand Prix and tiny nuggets of information about each track.
