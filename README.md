### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
#### I'm Chris â€“ a former agency owner and CEO, now looking for my next challenge.

I spent the last 16 years building and running an agency called [Chromatic](https://chromatichq.com). In early 2024, I sold my stake in the company to start a new chapter in my career. 

I've been writing software since the late 90's and leading engineering teams since 2008. I've written code for websites you've most certainly used. I believe in open source software, native apps over cross-platform frameworks, and in the power of empathetic leadership.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on rebuilding popular iOS apps with SwiftUI.
- ðŸŒ± Right now, I'm learning more advanced Swift and SwiftUI techniques.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m on the hunt for technical leadership roles at ambitious companies. 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking to help mid-level engineers and managers level up their careers.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: chris [@] chrisfree.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I was once reviewing a pull request that included a new bash script for clearing and syncing files across dev environments. When I ran it locally, it wiped my entire hard drive. Needless to say, the PR did not pass code review that day.
