### Hi there 👋
#### I'm Chris – a former agency owner and CEO, now helping developers make more money at [RevenueCat]([url](https://github.com/RevenueCat/)).

The greater part of my career was spent building and running an [agency](https://chromatichq.com) focused on enterprise content management systems. In early 2024, I sold my stake in the company to start a new chapter in my career. 

I've been writing software since the late 90's and leading engineering teams since 2008. I've written code for websites you've most certainly used. I believe in open source software, native apps over cross-platform frameworks, and in the power of empathetic leadership.

- 🧱 I’m currently [building a native GeoJSON Editor in MacOS](https://bsky.app/profile/chrisfree.bsky.social/post/3lbnhpyoowc2t).
- ✈️ I recently replicated [Flighty in SwiftUI](https://github.com/chrisfree/flightySwiftUI).
- 🏎️ [NextGP](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nextgp/id1638726743) is my Formula 1 app. 
- 👨🏻‍💻 I'm a co-maintainer of the [Jolpica Formula 1 project](https://github.com/jolpica/jolpica-f1)
- 👨‍🎓 I like to help mid-level engineers and managers level up their careers.

- ⚡ **Fun fact:** I was once reviewing a pull request that included a new bash script for syncing files across dev environments. When I ran it locally, it wiped my entire hard drive. Needless to say, the PR did not pass code review that day.
